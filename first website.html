<h1>Emiri Fujita</h1>


<p>I'm 14 years old and I go to Byng. I am part Japanese and part Swedish, some of my relatives live in Osaka and some live in Stockholm, Sweden.
 I have an annoying brother who plays the bagpipe every single day. I really like drama and musicals but I have no intentions of pursuing theatre acting. 
 My favorite movie is The Breakfast Club. I enjoy watching That 70's Show and Trailer Park Boys.
   I was born in Japan but I was raised in the states. When I was 5, my family moved to Arkansas because of my dad's job. I lived in Arkansas for about a year and then
   we moved to San Diego, California and lived there for about 5 years until we moved to Canada. I can speak Japanese fluently and a little bit of Swedish since my uncle
   taught me some Swedish when I was little but I mainly speak English.
   A place I would like to visit in the future is Tromso, Norway
 because the Northern Lights in Tromso hit different compared to other Northern Lights I've seen. There's also a Polarnight marathon held in Tromso once
 a year which I would like to participate if I have the chance.</p>
